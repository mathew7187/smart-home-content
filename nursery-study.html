<h1>Nursery/Study</h1>

<img src="glass walls.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>The Nursery and Study Rooms won a best award last year for the most relax rooms ever. With Music, Books, massagers, you named it! The Nursery and Study Rooms is all here for you.</p>

<h2>More about these rooms</h2>

<img src="media.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>The media room where you can read all of your books or go on your laptop at the table.</p>

<p>When there is fire, the house can dectect very easily and make a sound and voice. When the fire gets worst, it can automatically and easily call 9-1-1.</p>
<img src="music room.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>And the sound room can play all of your favorite tunes. Just connect it with your voice and shoutout the name of the song and artist on any room you like! It can also dectect any sound like if someone is breaking thru the backyard or frontyard and they make any noise, it can make an alarm and sounds to scare them away. And the music room has all the instruments you can play (and one of the most normal looking rooms compare to the others you already seen). Piano, violin, and guitar."</p>


<h3>Study</h3>

<img src="futuristic fire place.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>This fire place not only looks futuristic but  the 2nd most relaxing room in the house! It comes with a remote to turn it on from far distance and a sound player with original relaxing music. (I'm pretty sure everyone knows what a fire place is. Moving along.)</p> 
<img src="automatic voice clock.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>The Library has a automatic reader that can read any book for you. You can tell it to pause and save for another time and hop on to a new book.</p>
<img src="sound.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>Not only it plays music but that device is how the house can hear. It can even detect noises like if someone is outside and it can make an alarm to scare them away.</p>
<img src="chairs.png" width="300" height="200">
<p>The massage chair room comes with 6 chairs and headphones you can connect to any Bluetooth device or all can listen to the same music in that blue little screen globe.</p>
<p>When there is a room on fire, the house can detect it and immediately sound an alarm on the fire alarms and call 9-1-1 for you. There are a few more Nursery Rooms available in the house. (At least like 2 normal looking rooms.)</p>
