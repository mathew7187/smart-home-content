<p>This places have tons of fire alarms which I already explain how they work, there are just so many everywhere.</p> 
<p>The Ceiling walls have a waterfall in the backyard for you to listen and enjoy, but can you make it stop anytime you want by being on top of the roof and shutting it off.</p>
<p>We have water rats, all over the house. They have water inside and they like to splash water but they are clean and intelligent rats.</p>
<p>We have mini robots with green chemical inside and outside of them, they will help you with almost whatever you want just not anything because they are small.</p> 
<p>We also have snakes because why not. There are 20 of them in the house who looks like this image shown and taken in the crazy backyard.</p>

<p>There is a diswater covered in aluminum wedge that can clean all the dishes for you all by itself.</p> 
<p>There are not just intelligent mice, there are also artifical intelligent mice as well that can do much more than normal mice, Like clean up dirt and dust anywhere.</p> 
<p>There is also an incinerator. Yeah. Use that on any garbage all you want. That's about it. Nothing else to say about it.</p> 
<p>Oh yeah, the normal intelligent mices can take larger garbage to the incinerator. Okay, that's really all.</p>
